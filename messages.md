# Questions from SocialSpy Session

**Re: Adding a free account tier to VillaCare**

---

## What I Now Understand

From reading REVENUE.md and CURRENT-STATE.md:

**Current model:**
- Platform is already FREE for both owners and cleaners
- Revenue comes from:
  - 20% on first booking (platform-acquired)
  - 2.5% processing on repeats
  - 0% if cleaner brings own clients
- **Beta phase:** Direct payments (cash/Bizum), no Stripe yet

So "free account" must mean something different since the platform IS free...

---

## Clarifying Questions:

### 1. What do you mean by "free account"?
Since the platform is already free to use, are you thinking:

- **A) Free TRIAL?** - Let owners try without even creating an account?
- **B) Freemium tiers?** - Basic free, premium features for subscription?
- **C) Something for cleaners?** - Free tools/features before they book through platform?
- **D) Remove the 20% first-booking fee?** - As a promotion to grow?

### 2. What's the friction you're seeing?

Is the problem:
- Owners not signing up because they don't want to commit?
- Cleaners hesitant about the 20% fee?
- Competition offering something free that you don't?
- Too much signup friction before they see value?

### 3. What triggered this idea?

- User feedback?
- Competitor move?
- Investor suggestion?
- Just exploring options?

## My Initial Thoughts (Based on Platform Understanding)

### If the goal is MORE OWNERS:

The platform is already free - maybe the issue is **perceived friction**:
- Could offer "Browse without account" → Create account only when booking
- Show cleaner profiles, availability, and pricing without login
- Only require signup at checkout

### If the goal is MORE CLEANERS:

Currently free to join, 20% on first booking. Options:
- Waive the 20% for first X bookings (promotional)
- Offer "bring your own clients" prominently (they pay 0% platform fee)
- Success Coach features as the "free tier" value

### If you want FREEMIUM (tiers):

**Free Owner:**
- Browse cleaners
- Book via platform
- Basic messaging

**Premium Owner (€X/month):**
- Priority support
- Recurring booking management
- Property management features
- Multi-property dashboard

**Free Cleaner:**
- Profile listing
- Accept bookings
- Basic tools

**Premium Cleaner (€X/month):**
- Featured placement
- AI Success Coach (full access)
- Advanced analytics
- Team tools (without being team leader)

## What Would Help Me Give Better Advice:

1. **Who is churning/not converting?** Owners or cleaners?
2. **What's the signup-to-first-booking rate?**
3. **Are there specific features people ask for but don't have?**
4. **What are competitors charging/offering?**
