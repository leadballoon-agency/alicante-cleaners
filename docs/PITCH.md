# VillaCare Investor Pitch

## One-Liner

**Starting with cleaning. Expanding to all villa services. Ending in real estate.**

### The Structure

| Brand | URL | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **Alicante Cleaners** | alicantecleaners.com | Phase 1 - Live services platform |
| **VillaCare** | villacare.app | Parent brand - Investor relations |

Alicante Cleaners is the first market. VillaCare is the scalable brand for European expansion.

---

## The Problem

350,000+ vacation villas in Spain. Each one needs:
- Weekly cleaning
- Pool maintenance
- Garden care
- Handyman services
- Property management
- Eventually... to be sold

**Villa owners** are 2,000km away, don't speak Spanish, and can't find reliable help.

**Service providers** are stuck in the gig economy with no path to building a real business.

---

## The Solution

**VillaCare** - An AI-native platform connecting villa owners with trusted service providers.

### 8 AI Agents Power Everything

| Agent | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Sales Agent | Handles inquiries 24/7, books appointments |
| Support Agent | Answers owner & cleaner questions |

| Onboarding Agent | Guides new cleaners through setup |
| Admin Agent | 18+ tools for platform management |
| Owner Agent | Personal assistant for property owners |
| Cleaner Agent | Helps manage bookings & schedule |
| Investor Agent | Yes, even investor inquiries are AI-handled |

### Key Features

- **WhatsApp-native** - Meets users where they are (Spain runs on WhatsApp)
- **Multilingual** - 7 languages, auto-translated
- **Team system** - Cleaners build real businesses with specialists
- **Custom services** - Pool cleaning, gardening, laundry, handyman

## The Endgame: Real Estate

### The 3-Phase Roadmap

```
Phase 1: Services          Phase 2: Management       Phase 3: Real Estate
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Weekly cleaning visits     Property management       Buy, sell, invest
Trust building            Key holder services        AI-powered transactions
€60/clean                 €200-500/month            €15-25K/sale
```

### Why This Works

**Cleaners visit these properties every week.**

They know:
- When owners are thinking of selling (before anyone else)
- Property condition and maintenance history
- Neighborhood dynamics
- Owner pain points and motivations

**This is the Zillow play, but with a services moat.**

Zillow gets data from listings. We get it from relationships. Our cleaners are in these homes weekly, building trust that real estate agents can't match.

### The Math

| | Cleaning | Real Estate |
|---|----------|-------------|
| Avg Transaction | €60 | €500,000 |
| Our Commission | €12 (20%) | €15,000 (3%) |
| **Multiplier** | 1x | **1,250x** |

**One villa sale = 1,250 cleans worth of revenue.**
