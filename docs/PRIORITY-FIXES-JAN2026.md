## PRIORITY 1 — MUST FIX (Trust & Legal Alignment)

### 1. Unify payment & fee messaging (SITE-WIDE)

**Impact:** CRITICAL | **Effort:** Medium | **Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Decision made:** Beta = direct payment to cleaner, Post-beta = Stripe online payments

**Previous problem:**
| Page | Current Claim |
|------|---------------|
| Homepage | "Pay securely online" |
| Owner guides | "Pay cleaner directly / payments coming soon" |
| Cleaner pages | "Sin comisiones / keep what you earn" |
| Terms | Stripe, platform fee retained |

**Action:** Decide the truth, then align:
- Homepage
- `/guide` + `/guide/booking`
- `/join` + `/join/guide`
- `/terms`

**Decision needed:** What is the actual payment model TODAY?
- [ ] Owner pays online via Stripe, cleaner gets payout minus platform fee
- [ ] Owner pays cleaner directly, no platform fee (yet)
- [ ] Other arrangement

---

### 2. Fix "No passwords" vs Privacy Policy contradiction

**Impact:** HIGH | **Effort:** Low | **Status:** ✅ Fixed
