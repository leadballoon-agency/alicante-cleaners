2. **Book a Clean** - Select date, time, and service type
3. **Cleaner Confirms** - They accept and show up
4. **Leave a Review** - Help the community

**Need help?** See our step-by-step booking guide at `/guide/booking` with screenshots of every step.

## Service Types

| Service | Hours | Best For |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Regular Clean | 3h | Maintenance between visits |
| Deep Clean | 5h | Seasonal or post-rental |
| Arrival Prep | 4h | Before you arrive - includes optional extras |

## "I'm Coming Home" Feature

3. Choose optional extras:
   - **Fridge** - Stocked with essentials

## Properties

### Adding a Property
1. Go to Properties tab
2. Tap "Add Property"
3. Enter address, bedrooms, and access instructions
4. Add any special notes for cleaners

### Access Instructions
Be specific about:
- Key location or lockbox code
- Alarm codes if applicable
- Parking information
- Any areas to avoid or focus on

**Security note:** Access instructions are protected by our Just-In-Time (JIT) system. Your cleaner can only see these details 24 hours before the booking, and they're automatically hidden after the job completes.

### Key Holder Contact

If someone else has keys to your property (a neighbour, concierge, or property manager), you can add their contact details:

1. Go to Properties tab
2. Select your property
3. Add **Key Holder Name** (e.g., "John - Neighbour at #6")
4. Add **Key Holder Phone** (e.g., "+34 612 111 222")

**How it helps your cleaner:**
- They see the key holder's name and a **Call** button in their booking details
- One tap to call and arrange key collection
- No need to search through access notes for a phone number

**Security:**
- Key holder contact is only visible 24 hours before the booking (same as access notes)
- Only the assigned cleaner can see it
- Automatically hidden after the booking completes

## Reviews

After each completed booking, you can leave a review:
- Star rating (1-5)
- Written feedback
- Reviews help other owners choose cleaners

**Note**: Reviews are moderated before publishing.

## Messaging

- Messages are automatically translated
- Cleaners typically speak Spanish
- You'll see messages in English (or your preference)
- Tap "Show original" to see untranslated text

## Referral Program

Share your referral code with friends:
- They get a discount on their first booking
- You earn credit toward future bookings
- Find your code in Account tab

## Trusted Owner Status

- Multiple successful bookings

## Security & Privacy

Your property access details are protected by our **Sensitive Access Lifecycle**:

| When | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **You add access notes** | Encrypted with AES-256 and stored securely |
| **24 hours before booking** | Your assigned cleaner gains access |
| **After booking completes** | Access automatically revoked |

**Key protections:**
- Only your assigned cleaner sees access details
- No permanent storage of codes
- System-enforced, not policy-dependent
