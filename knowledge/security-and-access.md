## How VillaCare Protects Your Property Information

VillaCare takes the security of your property access details very seriously. Here's how we protect sensitive information like key locations, gate codes, and alarm codes.

## What Information is Sensitive?

The following should be considered sensitive and handled securely:

| Type | Examples | Sensitivity |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Key locations** | "Under the plant pot", "With the neighbor at #5" | High |
| **Gate/door codes** | PIN codes, keypad combinations | High |
| **Alarm codes** | Security system PINs | Very High |
| **Lock box codes** | Key safe combinations | High |
| **WiFi passwords** | Network access | Medium |
| **Parking instructions** | Bay numbers, permits | Low |

## Our Security Measures

### 1. Secure Collection
- Access notes are collected through our **secure booking form**, not through chat
- The form uses **HTTPS encryption** for data in transit
- Sensitive details are **never sent through third-party AI services**

### 2. Encrypted Storage
- Access notes are **encrypted at rest** in our database
- Even if someone accessed our database, they couldn't read your codes
- We use industry-standard AES-256 encryption

### 3. Just-In-Time Access
- Your cleaner can only see access details **24 hours before** the scheduled booking
- After the booking is complete, access notes are **hidden from view**
- This minimizes the window of exposure

### 4. Limited Access
- Only your **assigned cleaner** can view your property's access details
- Access is logged and auditable
- Admin staff cannot see your access codes

### 5. Automatic Cleanup
- For completed bookings, access notes can be **automatically archived**
- You can update or remove access notes at any time from your dashboard

## Best Practices for Property Owners

### DO:
- **Use a lock box or key safe** with a code you can change after each clean
- **Update codes periodically**, especially after staff changes
- **Use our secure form** to provide access details, not chat or messages
- **Consider smart locks** that can generate temporary codes per booking

### DON'T:
- **Never share alarm codes in chat messages** - use the secure form
- **Don't use the same code** for gate, door, and alarm
- **Avoid obvious codes** like 1234, 0000, or your address numbers
- **Don't share codes via SMS or WhatsApp** - these can be intercepted

## If You're Asked for Sensitive Details in Chat

If our assistant asks for access details during chat, it will guide you to enter them securely:

> "For your security, please don't share gate codes or key locations in this chat. You'll be able to add these details securely when you confirm your booking through the secure link we'll send you."

---

## Smart Lock Recommendations

For maximum security, consider installing a smart lock that integrates with booking systems:

- **Temporary codes**: Generate unique codes per booking
- **Time-limited access**: Codes only work during scheduled times
- **Audit trail**: See exactly when your property was accessed
- **Remote control**: Lock/unlock from anywhere

Popular options in Spain:
- Nuki Smart Lock
- Yale Linus
- Tedee
