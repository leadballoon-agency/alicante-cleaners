## Viewing Booking Details (Peek-to-Lock)

From your Home tab, you can view full booking details by **holding** on any booking card:

**How it works:**
- **Tap** a booking card → Quick view
- **Hold for 300ms** → Peek at details (release to close)
- **Hold for 1.5 seconds** → Lock modal open for full interaction

**What you'll see when locked:**
- Property address with **Maps** button (opens Google Maps app)

### Access Notes & Key Holders

**Access notes** contain important property information:

**Key holder** is someone who can let you in:

**Important - Just-In-Time Security:**

- Before that window, you'll see "Access notes will be available 24 hours before your booking"
- This protects the owner's sensitive information
- After the job is complete, this information is automatically hidden
