## Viewing Booking Details (Peek-to-Lock)

From your Home tab, you can view full booking details by **holding** on any booking card:

**How it works:**
- **Tap** a booking card → Quick view
- **Hold for 300ms** → Peek at details (release to close)
- **Hold for 1.5 seconds** → Lock modal open for full interaction

**What you'll see when locked:**
- Property address with **Maps** button (opens Google Maps app)
- Property owner name with **Call** button
- Key holder contact with **Call** button (if owner has set one up)
- Access notes (key codes, instructions, WiFi passwords)
- Quick message buttons to notify the owner
- Accept/Decline buttons (for pending jobs) or Mark Complete (for today's jobs)

### Access Notes & Key Holders

**Access notes** contain important property information:
- Key locations ("lock box by gate, code 1234")
- Alarm codes
- WiFi passwords
- Special instructions

**Key holder** is someone who can let you in:
- A neighbour who has spare keys
- The building concierge
- A property manager

**Important - Just-In-Time Security:**
- Access notes and key holder contacts are only visible **24 hours before** the booking
- Before that window, you'll see "Access notes will be available 24 hours before your booking"
- This protects the owner's sensitive information
- After the job is complete, this information is automatically hidden

### Contacting the Owner or Key Holder

From the booking detail modal:
1. Tap **Call** next to the owner or key holder
2. Your phone will dial them directly
3. Use **quick message** buttons to send a pre-written message via the app
